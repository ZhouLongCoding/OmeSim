Deciphering genetic basis of complex traits via genotype-phenotype association studies is a long-standing theme in genetics. The availability of multi-scale omics data has enabled re-searchers to utilize multiple "in-between-omes" in association studies. Although many statistical tests and machine learning models integrating multi-omics in genetic mapping are emerging, there is no standard way to simulate phenotype by genotype with the role of in-between-omes incorporated. Moreover, the involvement of in-between-omes usually bring substantial nonlinear architecture (e.g., co-expression network), that may be non-trivial to simulate. As such, power estimations, a critical step to test novel models, may not be routinely conducted in an unbiased way. To address the gap between emerging methods development and the unavailability of adequate simulators, we developed OmeSim, a phenotype simulator incorporating genetics, in-between-omes, and their complex relationships including nonlinear architectures. By applying representative tools in association studies integrating in-between-omes to the data simulated by OmeSim, we demonstrated the use-cases and flexibility of OmeSim.
